## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted indigo (#667eea) to represent a modern yet soothing auditory experience. 
- Background color: Very light gray (#f0f2f5), a barely tinted version of the primary color. This will offer a light, unobtrusive backdrop that puts the content first.
- Accent color: Teal (#20c997) to draw attention to interactive elements while complementing the overall color scheme.

- Simple, outline-style icons will be used for navigation and to represent different sections.
- A clean, responsive layout using a grid system, ensuring the site is easily navigable on all devices.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
